    "### TL;DR - Background\n",
    "#### Different Weather Causes Different Performance\n",
    "Weather-dependent models like building energy models generally use typical weather values to estimate a given metric for a system.  For example, typical weather values would be used to estimate the annual energy consumption of a building cooling system.  Inevitably, the actual weather the system experiences in the real world is _different_ than the weather used to create the model.  If the model is sensitive to weather the distinct typical & actual weather values will cause cumulative metrics to be different.  If the amplitude of these differences is larger than the cumulative impact of individual system elements (ex. the cooling system), it may not be possible to compare modeled and actual performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis by Spreadsheet\n",
    "The use cases below often require reporting & analysis that is easy to access, distribute, understand and review.  Therefore, energy engineers often must use spreadsheet software like MS Excel, Google Sheets, etc.  `noaa-weather-hourly` is developed for to support spreadsheet analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Financial Context of Energy Models\n",
    "Many building design choices must be made before a physical building exists, and once equipment is installed, changing design choices become costly.  The installed performance will likely persist as-is for a decade or more until equipment needs to be replaced.   The building owners and the environment will feel the impact of early-stage design choices every year until equipment is changed.  Because the life-cycle cost of _operating_ the equipment may be several times larger than the _initial purchase price_, it is cost-effective to develop energy models that optimize operational cost and inform system design choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement & Verification of Modeled Expectations\n",
    "Incentives and financing of high-efficiency solutions are ubiquitous.  When large financial incentives are in play, many providers must measure and verify (M&V) the true impact of specific system elements (energy conservation measures) to ensure that incentives are returning the intended results.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Energy Service Companies (ESCO) and other efficiency solutions providers often guarantee specific performance improvements in contracts (ie., 10% reduction in annual electricity cost due to cooling system replacement).  If the solution does not achieve the estimated savings, the ESCO is liable for the financial difference in operating cost and possibly more.  Observed performance improvements are determined by comparing a baseline model to observed performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, __the estimation of performance improvements is only valid if the impact of weather variance between model/baseline and observed reality is accounted for__. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:  Weather-normalization\n",
    "The solution to aligning the results of a model made with one set of weather values and actual results resulting from a different set of values is to weather-normalize the results.  This normalization process is only possible if both the typical and actual weather values are available.  Once the modeled and actual results are aligned (ie. the influence of weather variance is removed) the difference in expected and actual performance can be evaluated in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Availability of Free Weather Data\n",
    "Weather data is abundant & free in the modern connected world.  However, obtaining good, _usable_ data that is already available in the public forum is not necessarily easy or free of cost.  `noaa-weather-hourly` was created to facilitate convenient, free access to small volumes of hourly USA weather as a convenient .CSV file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous subscription or purchase-based [sources of historical weather]('#example-alternative-observed-weather-data-sources'), and many offer API access.  These sources may be the most cost-effective solution when many locations are needed and/or the data need to be updated frequently."
